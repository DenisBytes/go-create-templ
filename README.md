# go-create-templ

The opinionated version of "npx create-next-app", where you will have HTMX, Templ, Air, Supabase, Bun (ORM), Bunjs, and a framework of choice.

The login boilerplate code will be setup for you.


## Work in Progres

## Update

In the following days i'll publish the package (need to look it up on how to do it).
The only frameworks will be (for now) Chi, Echo and the standard library.
